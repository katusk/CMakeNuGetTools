# CMakeNuGetTools (WIP)

CMakeNuGetTools has CMake functions for adding NuGet package dependencies with CMake exports or native `.targets` files, generating and merging `.nuspec` files, calling nuget pack, and more. See Examples section below, and the `tests` directory for CMake projects using the functions: relevant function names are prefixed with `nuget_`.

## Examples

You can download NuGet package dependencies and let CMake know about CMake export files in those packages via `nuget_add_dependencies()` calls:

```cmake
# Call this once before any other nuget_* calls.
nuget_initialize()

# NuGet install icu and flatbuffers packages, and import their CMake export files.
nuget_add_dependencies(
    PACKAGE flatbuffers.x64-windows.vcpkg-export VERSION 1.11.0-1 CMAKE_PREFIX_PATHS installed/x64-windows
    PACKAGE icu.x64-windows.vcpkg-export PUBLIC VERSION 65.1.0-2 CMAKE_PREFIX_PATHS installed/x64-windows
)

# After the above nuget_add_dependencies(), you can:
find_package(ICU REQUIRED COMPONENTS data uc io)
find_package(Flatbuffers CONFIG REQUIRED)
```

Above works with all CMake generators. If you are only using a Visual Studio generator with CMake, you can also write the following. Please note this is rather not CMakeish: `.targets` files are primarily intended for Visual Studio projects only.

```cmake
# Creates a "flatbuffers" build target you can link against.
nuget_add_dependencies(
    PACKAGE flatbuffers.x64-windows.vcpkg-export
    VERSION 1.11.0-1
    IMPORT_DOT_TARGETS_AS flatbuffers
    INCLUDE_DIRS "installed/x64-windows/include"
)
```

You get some helper functions for NuGet packages added via `nuget_add_dependencies()`. For example:

```cmake
nuget_get_installed_dependencies_dirs(DEPENDENCIES_DIRS)
```

You can generate `.nuspec` files using the power of CMake including the use of generator expressions via the `nuget_generate_nuspec_files()` function, see following example. This function uses the `file(GENERATE ...)` built-in of CMake and some argument parsing at its core.

```cmake
nuget_generate_nuspec_files(
    # CMake-specific arguments section
    CMAKE_OUTPUT_DIR ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/CMakeNuGetTools
    CMAKE_CONFIGURATIONS Release Debug
    # NuSpec-related sections

## Setup

1. Install the [`nuget.exe` CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/install-nuget-client-tools#nugetexe-cli) on your platform: installation instructions can be found [here for Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/install-nuget-client-tools#windows), and [here for macOS/Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/install-nuget-client-tools#macoslinux). Make sure you can properly use the NuGet CLI from your command line or terminal: NuGet feeds are [configured](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuget-config-file) properly, your NuGet credentials are valid, etc.

2. Copy the contents of the `cmake` subdirectory of the CMakeNuGetTools root directory into a subdirectory in your project's root directory. We use `scripts/CMakeNuGetTools` as a destination directory example here.

3. Include the `NuGetTools.cmake` script either in the root `CMakeLists.txt` of your CMake-based project, or in your CMake script file from which you want to use the CMake functions, e.g.:

   ```cmake
   include("${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/scripts/CMakeNuGetTools/NuGetTools.cmake")
   ```

4. Set the `NUGET_COMMAND` CMake cache variable to reference the previously installed NuGet CLI.
   * If simply executing `nuget.exe` at your command line or terminal works, you can set the value of the cache variable to `nuget.exe`, e.g. when executing the CMake CLI: `cmake -DNUGET_COMMAND=nuget.exe ...`.
   * Of course, you can also provide an absolute path to `nuget.exe` when setting the `NUGET_COMMAND` cache variable.
   * Alternatively, you can use CMake's `find_program(NUGET_COMMAND ...)` in your CMake scripts.

CMakeNuGetTools can be thought of as an intrinsic part of the build scripting of your CMake-based projects, and as such it is preferably present in your repositories as a copy. No specific location within your repository is required for the CMakeNuGetTools CMake scripts found under the `cmake` subdirectory in this repository in order to work properly. Only relative locations within the `cmake` subdirectory need to be retained if you copy over the scripts.

### A Quick Tour

The `NuGetTools.cmake` script currently includes all other required CMakeNuGetTools CMake scripts, so that you can call any of the provided `nuget_*()` functions after including `NuGetTools.cmake` in *your* CMake scripts. (Every other script file outside the `cmake` subdirectory in the CMakeNuGetTools repository is currently only used for stand-alone testing.)

The `nuget_initialize`, `nuget_add_dependencies`, `nuget_generate_nuspec_files` functions, and some helper functions are primarily intended to be used from a `CMakeLists.txt` file. The `nuget_generate_nuspec_files` function is especially to be used from `CMakeLists.txt` files only, as it calls CMake's built-in `file(GENERATE)` in the end: output files are only written after processing all of a project's `CMakeLists.txt` files. See test project subdirectories under the `tests` subdirectory in this repository for example uses of these functions.

Calling `nuget_merge_nuspec_files` and `nuget_pack` is primarily intended to be done outside of `CMakeLists.txt` files: they can be called from CMake script files (on top of your project descriptor `CMakeLists.txt` files) driving the build system generation, triggering the actual build and install of the project, etc. See `CMakeLists.pack.cmake` (which is used from `CMakeLists.txt`) as a simple example in the root directory of this repository.

## Scope

CMakeNuGetTools aims to be the cross-platform NuGet package management solution for CMake-based C/C++ projects. At its core, it is a CMake wrapper around the [NuGet command-line interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/install-nuget-client-tools#nugetexe-cli) (NuGet CLI), that "provides all NuGet capabilities on Windows, provides most features on Mac and Linux when running under Mono".

Relying solely on the NuGet CLI means that CMakeNuGetTools is not depending on any of the existing MSBuild, Visual Studio, or dotnet CLI tooling for NuGet-related capabilities. You can use any CMake generator and build toolchain you want.

For extracting semantic version information for the creation of automatically versioned NuGet packages, CMakeNuGetTools currently relies on the git CLI. Features around querying version tags are optional: the git CLI is only needed if you need automatic versioning features.

### Context

CMakeNuGetTools was born with the following considerations in mind from the perspective of a cross-platform CMake-based C/C++ project:

* CMakeNuGetTools should only rely on the cross-platform and stand-alone NuGet CLI for NuGet-related capabilities.
* One should be able to automatically create a versioned NuGet package per platform (Windows, Linux, or macOS) from this project containing both Debug and Release native binaries that can be consumed by other CMake projects, `.vcxproj`-based C/C++ projects on Windows, and `.csproj`-based managed C# projects on all supported platforms by .NET Core. (You need [PInvoke](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/native-interop/pinvoke) bindings for C/C# interoperability of course: we are solely talking about the NuGet infrastructure itself here.)
* One should be able to easily put additional NuGet-related customized or generated files, like `.targets` files under the `build/native`, `build`, or `buildTransitive` directories inside the NuGet package to be created. Without this, one cannot achieve some of the goals in the previous point.
* One should be able to create multiple NuGet packages with different directory layouts from this project. For example, one package containing both Debug and Release binaries in a custom directory layout, and another package containing only Release binaries conforming to the conventional NuGet package directory layout under the [`runtimes` directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog) inside the package.
* One should be able to use multiple other NuGet packages from this project also differentiating between PUBLIC (installed and propagated as NuGet package dependency), PRIVATE (installed only), and INTERFACE (propagated as NuGet package dependency only) dependencies. For example, NuGet packages to be consumed containing only static libraries that are only used internally, or NuGet packages containing libraries only used for testing can be marked as PRIVATE; and NuGet packages containing shared libraries can be marked as PUBLIC.

## Queued Tasks
* Create scripts extracting individual packages from Vcpkg as *separate* NuGet packages
* Finish up semantic versioning-related functionality
* Code several small extensions to existing functionality
* Create a meta-build example with a native library project, a managed wrapper project, and a managed app project
* Write documentation
